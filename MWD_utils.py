def soft_fairness(gamma,A):
    '''
    Function for determining fairness of a soft clustering output.
    Fairness is defined in terms of entropy of the cluster configuration.
    Finds the entropy for one protected group over all clusters. 

    Input Parameters
    ----------
    gamma : np.array (responsibility matrix of dimension N x k)
    A     : np.array (protected attribute vector of length N)
    
        Input is responsibility vector gamma and protected attribute vector A.

    Returns
    ---------
    H       : float (entropy of cluster configuration)
    H_ratio : float (entropy ratio of cluster configuration)
    balance : float (cluster balance from cluster with minimum balance)
    
        Outputs soft entropy, entropy ratio and balance of cluster configuration. 
        Entropy ratio is defined by ratio of cluster entropy to the optimal entropy
        for the number of clusters (i.e. same proportion of fraction of protected attribute in all clusters).
